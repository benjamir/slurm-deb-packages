Description: Cuda-drivers mock package (meta)
  CUDA driver packages are required by various meta-packages, such as CUDA.
  However, in containerized environments, drivers are not installed via traditional packages but through tools like `nvidia-container-toolkit` or the k8s GPU Operator.

  These empty (mock) packages trick `apt/dpkg` into thinking that the driver is installed via standard packages.
  As a result, other packages that depend on the driver as a dependency can be installed and used without issues.
